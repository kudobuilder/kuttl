#
# used to run kuttl tests from docker
# it is expected that a mount pt is provided where /opt/project is the root of the testsuite
# the root of the mount point needs a `kuttl-test.yaml` and a proper `kubeconfig` file which
# a process running in docker can reach.  If using kind, then `kind get kubeconfig --internal > kubeconfig`
# will provide the proper configuration for 0.7.0.  0.8.0 breaks this ability and is being worked on in the
# kind community.
# Assuming a test folders at mount root named "e2e" then:
# docker run -v $PWD:/opt/project kuttl e2e
# will run tests against the e2e folders.
#
# IF you want run tests from within a cluster, then specify `-e KUBECONFIG=`.  An empty KUBECONFIG will
# result in kuttl using the in-cluster-config.
# ex. docker run -e KUBECONFIG= -v $PWD:/opt/project kuttl e2e
# artifacts by default will land in the root of the mount point.
