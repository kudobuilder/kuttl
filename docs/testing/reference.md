# KUTTL Configuration Reference

## TestSuite

The `TestSuite` object specifies the settings for the entire test suite and should live in the test suite configuration file (`kuttl-test.yaml` by default, or `--config`):

```yaml
apiVersion: kuttl.dev/v1beta1
kind: TestSuite
startKIND: true
kindContainers:
- your/image:latest
testDirs:
- tests/e2e/
timeout: 120

## TestStep

The `TestStep` object can be used to specify settings for a test step and can be specified in any test step YAML.

```yaml
apiVersion: kuttl.dev/v1beta1
kind: TestStep
apply:
- my-new-resource.yaml
assert:
- my-asserted-new-resource.yaml
error:
- my-errored-new-resource.yaml
unitTest: false
delete:
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  name: my-pod
commands:
- command: helm init
kubeconfig: foo.kubeconfig
```

Supported settings:

Field    | Type                          | Description
---------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------
apply    | list of files                 | A list of files to apply as part of this step. Specified path is relative to that in which the step occurs.
assert   | list of files                 | A list of files to assert as part of this step. See documentation for [asserts and errors](asserts-errors.md) for more information. Specified path is relative to that in which the step occurs.
error    | list of files                 | A list of files to error as part of this step. See documentation for [asserts and errors](asserts-errors.md) for more information. Specified path is relative to that in which the step occurs.
delete   | list of object references     | A list of objects to delete, if they do not already exist, at the beginning of the test step. The test harness will wait for the objects to be successfully deleted before applying the objects in the step.
index    | int                           | Override the test step's index.
commands | list of [Commands](#commands) | Commands to run prior at the beginning of the test step.
kubeconfig    | string                        | The Kubeconfig file to use to run the included steps(s).
kubeconfigLoading    | string                        | Specifies the mode for loading Kubeconfig and making a cluster connection: `Eager` (when loading the test definition) or `Lazy` (right before executing the step, makes it possible to generate the Kubeconfig in a preceding step). Defaults to `Eager`.
context     | string                        | Specifies the context to use from the Kubeconfig.
unitTest    | bool                          | Indicates if the step is a unit test, safe to run without a real Kubernetes cluster.


Object Reference:

Field      |   Type | Description
-----------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------
apiVersion | string | The Kubernetes API version of the objects to delete.
kind       | string | The Kubernetes kind of the objects to delete.
name       | string | If specified, the name of the object to delete. If not specified, all objects that match the specified labels will be deleted.
namespace  | string | The namespace of the objects to delete.
labels     | map    | If specified, a label selector to use when looking up objects to delete. If both labels and name are unspecified, then all resources of the specified kind in the namespace will be deleted.

## TestAssert

The `TestAssert` object can be used to specify settings for a test step's assert and must be specified in the test step's assert YAML.

```yaml
apiVersion: kuttl.dev/v1beta1
kind: TestAssert
timeout: 30
commands:
- command: echo hello
collectors:
- type: pod
  pod: nginx
```

Supported settings:

Field   | Type | Description                                           | Default
--------|------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------
timeout | int  | Number of seconds that the test is allowed to run for | 30
collectors | list of [collectors](#collectors) | The collectors to be invoked to gather information upon step failure | N/A
commands | list of [commands](#commands) | Commands to run prior to the beginning of the test step. | N/A

## TestFile

A `TestFile` object can be used to provide configuration concerning a single YAML test file that contains it.

```yaml
apiVersion: kuttl.dev/v1beta1
kind: TestFile
testRunSelector:
  matchLabels:
    flavor: vanilla
```

Supported settings:

| Field           | Type           | Description                                                                                                                     | Default                                                      |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| testRunSelector | label selector | If this selector does not match [labels of this test run](#test-run-labels-and-selectors), the containing file will be ignored. | Empty label selector (matches all possible test label sets). |


### Test Run Labels and Selectors

An invocation of `kuttl test` may specify a label set associated with a test run using a command line flag.
One can then use a `TestFile` object with `testRunSelector` to decide whether a given test YAML file should be included
in a test run or not.

## Collectors

The `Collectors` object is used by the `TestAssert` object as a way to collect certain information about the outcome of an `assert` or `errors` step should it fail. A collector is only invoked in cases where a failure occurs and not if the step succeeds. Collection can occur from Pod logs, Namespace events, or the output of a custom command.

Supported settings:

Field   | Type | Description                                           | Default
--------|------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------
type | string  | Type of collector to run. Values are one of `pod`, `command`, or `events`. If the field named `command` is specified, `type` is assumed to be `command`. If the field named `pod` is specified, `type` is assumed to be `pod`. | `pod`
pod | string  | The pod name from which to access logs. | N/A
namespace | string  | Namespace in which the pod or events can be located. | N/A
container | string  | Container name inside the pod from which to fetch logs. If empty assumes all containers. | unset
selector | string  | Label query to select a pod. | N/A
tail | int  | The number of last lines to collect from a pod. | 10 (if selector); all (if pod name)
command | string  | Command to run. Requires an empty type or type `command`. Must not specify fields `pod`, `namespace`, `container`, or `selector` if present. | N/A

## Commands

The `Commands` object is used by `TestStep`, `TestAssert`, and `TestSuite` to enable running commands in tests:

Field         |   Type | Description
--------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------
command       | string | The command and argument to run as a string.
script        | string | Allows a shell script to run - namespaced and command should not be used with script.  namespaced is ignored and command is an error.  env expansion is depended upon the shell but ENV is passed to the runtime env.
namespaced    | bool   | If set, the `--namespace` flag will be appended to the command with the namespace to use (the test namespace for a test step or "default" for the test suite).
ignoreFailure | bool   | If set, failures will be ignored.
background    | bool   | If this command is to be started in the background. These are only support in TestSuites.
skipLogOutput | bool   | If set, the output from the command is *not* logged. Useful for sensitive logs or to reduce noise.
timeout       | int    | Override the TestSuite timeout for this command (in seconds).

*Note*: The current working directory (CWD) for `command`/`script` is the test directory.
